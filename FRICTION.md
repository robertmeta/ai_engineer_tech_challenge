Friction
========
Document any point of friction, no matter how small here, so that we can smooth
out the process of doing development. From too many meetings to a slow dev
cycle, etc, no point of friction is too small.

- The lack of specifics by which this will be judged makes it somewhat tricky,
  but as a high level tech screen it probably just needs to show general
  cluefulness.
