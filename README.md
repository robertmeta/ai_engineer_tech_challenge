Skyward tech challenge for AI engineer position

TL;DR
-----
I put a lot of artifacts in this project to emulate how I would run an actual team in terms of tracking progress, I very strongly believe in keeping stuff in git and close to the developers fingertips. I am for radical transparency and tracking things like points of friction in a friction log. Accomplishments in BRAGS.md, etc. 

I also strive to make the developer environment extremly straightforward to get up and running with by putting all the complexity into the dockerfile so they can get up and running in minutes. Stuff like watchers, autoformatters, terraform, d2 diagram compiler, etc all live in the docker. Locally devs should only need docker and make.
